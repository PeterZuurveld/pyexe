# pyexe.exe

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/n18f0997k18x87lw/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/manthey/pyexe/branch/master)

I have often wanted a stand-alone version of python that is a single Windows executable.

It consists of the most recent versions of Python (with builds for 2.7 32-bit, 2.7 64-bit, 3.5 32-bit,
3.5 64-bit, and 3.6 64-bit), pywin32, psutil, six, and includes all packages that can be included
without additional dlls, excepting tkinter.

See the appveyor script for build instructions.

Go ahead and use the executable or source as you see fit.  Credit is appreciated, but not necessary.  I accept no liability.  

If you found this useful, let me know.  Please file any issues.  Obviously, one could include more or less libraries to either add features or reduce the size of the executable.  I don't intend to make alternate versions with different libraries.
